# Defiance-Assets

This repository exists to comply with share-alike licensed assets used during
development of [Days of Defiance](https://defiance.robopoets.com).

Each folder contains attribution to the original asset and all derived assets
that are the result of modifying the original one. Where practical, additional
assets are provided that are not strictly necessary to comply with the license,
but make it easier to use the derived assets or understand the context in which
the derived assets are used in the game.

If you want to use any of the derived assets found in this repository, the
original license applies.
